# Trigonometric_Function
This is a simple trigonometric function calculator implemented in MATLAB. 
It can calculate sine (sin), cosine (cos), arcsine (arcsin), and arctangent (arctan) functions.
Users can input either radians or specific values to obtain the corresponding results. 
The calculator provides accurate calculations and also compares the results with MATLABâ€™s built-in trigonometric function library to show the relative error.
